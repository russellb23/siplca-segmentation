SIPLCA Music Analysis
=====================

This package contains the implementation of the algorithm for
identifying repeated harmonic patterns in music and structure
segmentation described in [1]. 

Currently porting the code to python2.0 to python3.0 and trying optimizations (if there is/are avenues). 
Largely in the preliminary stage.
